SQL Server name:	jf-dbs
Database name:	FunDoo_DB (SQL Server auth only - to keep things simple)
SQL Server Admin (sa) username: mysa
SQL Server Admin (sa) password: password12/


Since I am not in an Organization context, I will only allow SQL Server Auth, and thus will not be creating any audit fields for CreatedBy & UpdatedBy

Application user:
Username: FunDooDbUser 
Password: DbUser123#
